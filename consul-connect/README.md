# Ambassador Consul Connect Integration

## Install Consul

To get Ambassador working with Consul Connect, first you need to install consul in your cluster.

We will install Consul via Helm.

**Note:** The `values.yaml` file is used to configure the helm installation. See [documentation](https://www.consul.io/docs/platform/k8s/helm.html#configuration-values-) on different options.

```shell
helm repo add consul https://consul-helm-charts.storage.googleapis.com
helm install --name=consul consul/consul -f ./values.yaml
```

This will install Consul with Connect enabled. 

**Note:** Sidecar auto-injection is not configured by default and can enabled by setting `connectInject.default: true` in the `values.yaml` file.

## Verify the consul installation

Verify you Consul installation by accessing the Consul UI. 

```shell
kubectl port-forward service/consul-ui 8500:80
open localhost:8500/
```

If the UI loads correctly and you see the consul service, it is safe to assume consul is installed correctly.

## Install Ambassador

Next you will need to install Ambassador. Do this with `kubectl`

```shell
kubectl apply -f ambassador-pro.yaml
kubectl apply -f ambassador-service.yaml
```
This installs the Ambassador deployment and service. A cloud load balancer will be deployed and configured to listen on port 80 for http requests and forward those requests to Ambassador over port 80.

## Install the demo QoTM service

Next we will deploy the QoTM service. We will do this before deploying the consul connect integration to show how Ambassador requires the secret created by that service to successfully route to the QoTM pod with the connect sidecar

```shell
kubectl apply -f qotm.yaml
```

Then send a curl to the service to verify it does not work.

```shell
curl -v http://{AMBASSADOR_IP}/qotm/

< HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable

< server: envoy

upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers[nkrause@MacBook-Pro consul-connect
```

## Install the Consul Connect Integration

Finally we will install the connect integration so Ambassador can route to the connect-powered QoTM service.

```shell
kubectl apply -f ambassador-consul-connector.yaml
```

#### Verify the pod started correctly

```shell
kubectl get pods

#### Verify the secret `ambassador-consul-connect` was created 

```shell
kubectl get secrets

ambassador-consul-connect                                 kubernetes.io/tls                     2
